## My Process

### Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Desktop-first workflow

### A Personal Note

I started this challenge at the start of October, but then my back seized up. This meant I had to suddenly stop everything coding related and focus on recovery. After multiple intense sessions every single week with my Personal Trainer and Osteopath, I have managed to stabilize my back enough so that I can finally continue my journey learning to code. I immediately continued where I left off with this challenge.

### What I Learned

In this particular project:

1. I learned about `padding-inline-start` and the benefits it has for being able to switch between left-to-right and right-to-left script direction without any changes needing to be made to the code.

```css
.card__list {
  padding-inline-start: var(--sp-20px);
}
```

2. In my previous projects, the _prettier_ extension in vscode has always been changing my html code to sometimes separate one element into multiple lines instead of just one. Adding the following `printWidth` override seems to have fixed this:

```css
 {
  "singleQuote": false,
  "arrowParens": "avoid",

  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": "index.html",
      "options": {
        "printWidth": 250
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Continued Development

After submitting this project, I wish to develop the following:

1. Going forward, I would like to keep my CSS code a little more tidy earlier within the development of the project instead of a massive clean up at the end. Just a simple case of staying more organized. Perhaps I will try adding checkpoints to do this.

### Useful Resources

- [Padding-Inline-Start(MDN Documentation)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-inline-start) - Demo has `writing-mode` which is useful to see how it works.

## Noteworthy Updates Since Initial Submission

1. No major updates since submitted.
